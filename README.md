#Theme
This is an interactive instrument based on capacitive sensing circuitry,
You're enjoying an evening campfire in the woods, use the mug to create some ambience, but beware of things lurking in the forest or the WATER...

#Objective
To produce an interactive piece using capacitive sensing to generate a unique soundscape via the ChucK software.

#Preperation
This project utilises an Arduino UNO R3 board along with a circuit setup outlined in bonniee's mug-music: https://github.com/bonniee/mug-music and madlabdk's touche_peak file: https://github.com/madlabdk/touche
